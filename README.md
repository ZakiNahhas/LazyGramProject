# LazyGramProject


## The idea of our project was inspired by the well-known social media application, Instagram. We thought of creating an application for people who would like to share their memories with family and friends. Our application allows each user to upload photos of their memories and achievements  on their personal accounts, they also can follow other users, add comments and like each other posts. In this app, users will also have the ability to communicate and chat with others.


## Features 
- Making it easier to communicate
- Sharing special moments with loved ones
